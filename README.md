# Vue 3 Shopping List App

This is a simple **Vue 3** project I built while learning the Composition API. It lets you:

- Add items to a shopping list
- Remove or clear the list
- Save multiple shopping lists to `localStorage`
- Load, email, or delete saved lists

Demonstrates Vue reactivity, form binding, dynamic lists, and local storage usage.
